Expand greatly upon the topic of "What is a DDoS attack?" in the context of computer science in british english:

1. What is a DDoS attack?

A DDoS attack is an attack where a large number of requests are sent to a target over a short period of time in order to overload its ability to respond. This can result in the target being unable to service legitimate requests or being slowed down to the point where it cannot function.

2. How do DDoS attacks work?

There are a number of different ways that a DDoS attack can work. One popular method is called a SYN floods. This is where a target is flooded with SYN requests, which are requests that are used to establish a connection. Once the target has responded to the SYN requests, the attacker can then flood it with requests that are used to send data. This causes the target to become overloaded and unable to serve legitimate requests.

3. What are the consequences of a DDoS attack?

The consequences of a DDoS attack can vary, but generally they will reduce the target's ability to function or be attacked.
In some cases, the target may even be forced to shut down.

4. How can you protect against DDoS attacks?

One way to protect against DDoS attacks is to have a robust protection system in place. This will help to prevent the target from becoming overloaded and unable to service legitimate requests. 

Another way to protect against DDoS attacks is to avoid being a target. This means avoiding sites and services that are often attacked.

5. What are the different types of DDoS attacks?
