Expand greatly upon the topic of "Algorithms: Predicting the Outcomes of Events" in the context of computer science summarised for a 9th grader:

1. What is an algorithm?

An algorithm is a set of step by step instructions for solving a problem.

2. What are the types of algorithms?

There are three main types of algorithms: deterministic, probabilistic, and symbolic.

3. How do algorithms work?

An algorithm works by taking the input data and using it to calculate the output data.

4. What are the benefits of using algorithms?
