One popular method is called a SYN floods. This is where a target is flooded with SYN requests, which are requests that are used to establish a connection. Once the target has responded to the SYN requests, the attacker can then flood it with requests that are used to send data. This causes the target to become overloaded and Unable to serve legitimate requests.\n\n", "index": 0, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 109, "completion_tokens": 92, "total_tokens": 201}}
