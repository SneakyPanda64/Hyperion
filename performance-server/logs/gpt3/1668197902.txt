1. Security vulnerabilities in serverless architecture

Serverless architectures, a form of software architecture where applications are run on autonomous, selfconfigured servers, present a number of security challenges. Unlike traditional centralized architectures, serverless architectures lack centralized points of control that can be exploited in order to gain access to data or systems. As a result, serverless architectures are especially vulnerable to attack from unauthorized users or malicious actors.

One common type of attack against serverless architectures is Typhoeus, a malware that infiltrates serverless systems and exploits vulnerabilities in their software. Typhoeus can then be used to compromising systems, steal data, and launch other attacks.

Another security challenge posed by serverless architectures is data loss. Because serverless systems are designed to run automation tasks without any need for human input, they are susceptible to data loss in the event of a server failure.

In order to combat these security vulnerabilities, developers must take a number of precautions when developing serverless applications. These precautions include ensuring that all software dependencies are properly vetted, establishing strong security protocols, and configuring serverless systems with proper security measures.
