Expand greatly upon the topic of "What is the difference between a heuristic and an algorithm?" in the context of computer science in british english:

1. What is the difference between a heuristic and an algorithm?

A heuristic is a rule of thumb that a computer scientist might use to get a rough approximation of the solution to a problem. An algorithm, on the other hand, is a specific, specific way of solving a problem.

2. How do heuristics and algorithms differ in terms of their application?
