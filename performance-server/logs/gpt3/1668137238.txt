Extract tags that are directly related to "computer science" from the following passage of text in a list format:

passage: A heuristic is a rule of thumb that a computer scientist might use to get a rough approximation of the solution to a problem. An algorithm, on the other hand, is a specific, specific way of solving a problem. Heuristics are often used in situations where the specific algorithm is not necessary or the time required to execute the algorithm might be prohibitive. Algorithms, on the other hand, are often used in situations where the exact solution to a problem is necessary. The benefits of using heuristics are that they can be timesaving and they may result in a close approximation of the solution to a problem. The drawback of using heuristics is that they may not always be the most accurate solution. Heuristics can be used effectively in computer science by recognizing common patterns or setups that occur in problems.
Once the heuristic has been identified, the computer scientist can use it to approximate the solution to the problem. The heuristics used in computer science can often be divided into two categories: algorithmic heuristics and domainspecific heuristics.An algorithmic heuristics is a method that is based on the application of an algorithm to a problem.
A domainspecific heuristics, on the other hand, is a method that is specific to a particular problem domain. Heuristics can improve the efficiency of an algorithm by allowing the computer scientist to use a smaller amount of data to approximate the solution to the problem. Additionally, heuristics may help optimize the algorithm by reducing the number of algorithm executions that are required to solve the problem. Heuristics can impact the accuracy of results by leading to an approximation of the solution to the problem. Additionally, heuristics may not always be applicable to a given problem. If the computer scientist is not sure if he or she is using a heuristic, the accuracy of the results may be impacted. Heuristics can affect the run time of an algorithm by reducing the amount of time that is required to solve the problem. Additionally, heuristics may help reduce the amount of data that is required to solve the problem. There is a memory impact of heuristics on algorithms in that heuristics can sometimes require the storage of information that is specific to the problem.
Additionally, heuristics may consume memory by taking up memory space on the computer. Other factors that can impact
