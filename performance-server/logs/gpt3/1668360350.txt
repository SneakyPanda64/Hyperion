Expand greatly upon the topic of "The fascinating world of algorithms for computer graphics" in the context of computer science summarised for a 9th grader:

1. What are algorithms?

In computing, an algorithm is a set of instructions that are followed in order to solve a problem or accomplish a task. Algorithms are typically written as a series of steps that can be carried out by a computer.

2. What are some common algorithms used in computer graphics?
