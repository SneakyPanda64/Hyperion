Expand greatly upon the topic of "The Benefits of Algorithms in Artificial Intelligence" in the context of computer science summarised for a 9th grader:

1. How algorithms can be used to create artificial intelligence

Algorithms can be used to create artificial intelligence by teaching computers how to recognize patterns and make decisions. For example, a computer can be taught to play chess by being given a set of rules to follow. The computer will then use these rules to try to beat its opponent.
