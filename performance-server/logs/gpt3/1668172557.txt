Extract tags that are directly related to "computer science" from the following passage of text in a list format:

passage: design. First, censorshipresistant systems are not immune to malicious insider attacks. Second, censorshipresistant systems can be difficult or impossible to use for nontechnical users. Third, censorshipresistant systems can be difficult or impossible to scale up to handle large quantities of data. Censorshipresistant design can be used to protect privacy by making it difficult or impossible for outside observers to access user data. This could be valuable in cases where privacy is under threat from oppressive governments or criminal organizations. There are a few ethical implications of censorshipresistant design. First, censorshipresistant systems can be used to Kantian splittigation of the population, in which the privileged elites are able to access information that is critical to their political power while the rest of the population is disenfranchised. Second, censorshipresistant systems can be used to support the surveillance state, in which the government collects and stores large quantities of user data. The future directions of censorshipresistant design are still being explored. Some researchers are working on developing secure algorithms and protocols that are resistant to tampering by malicious outsiders, while others are working on building robust and userfriendly systems that are aware of user needs and preferences.
