Expand greatly upon the topic of "Algorithms: The Key to Security and Cryptography" in the context of computer science summarised for a 9th grader:

1. What is an algorithm?

An algorithm is a set of rules that tell a computer what to do. These rules can be inputted into a computer and will produce a specific result. Algorithms play an important role in security and cryptography because they help encrypt data and protect it from being read by unauthorized people.

2. What are the key components of an algorithm?
