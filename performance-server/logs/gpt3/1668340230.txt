Expand greatly upon the topic of "Algorithms: The Key to Security and Cryptography" in the context of computer science summarised for a 9th grader:

1. What is an algorithm?

An algorithm is a set of rules that tell a computer what to do. These rules can be inputted into a computer and will produce a specific result. Algorithms play an important role in security and cryptography because they help encrypt data and protect it from being read by unauthorized people.

2. What are the key components of an algorithm?

The key components of an algorithm are the instructions that tell the computer what to do. These instructions are written in a specific language, and they are used to make the algorithm work. The instructions can be complicated, but they all have one simple goal: to produce a particular result.

3. How do algorithms work?
