Physical computers are limited by their physical resources. For example, one physical computer can only handle a certain number of calculations per second, while a virtual machine can make use of more resources, such as more processors or more memory, to handle more calculations. Additionally, virtual machines can be configured to mimic the physical characteristics of different types of computers, such as x86 or 64-bit processors, in order to run software that needs to be executed on a particular type or shape of computer.", "index": 0, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 51, "completion_tokens": 135, "total_tokens": 186}}
