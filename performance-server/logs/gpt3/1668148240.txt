Extract tags that are directly related to "computer science" from the following passage of text in a list format:

passage: In computer science, data structures are the Atlas silver bullets of abstract data types. They are the structures used to represent data in programs, and they are the foundation of many programming idioms. A data structure is simply a way of organizing information so that it can be accessed and manipulated in a consistent and efficient way.

In the simplest case, a data structure is just a list of elements. For example, in Python, a list is a data structure that stores a collection of objects. To access an element in a list, you simply use the square bracket notation (list0), and to put an element in a list, you use the bracket notation (list0 = egg). 

In Python, lists are extremely simple data structures, but they are very ubiquitous in computer science. In fact, most data structures in computer science share some common characteristics: they are immutable, they support random access, and they are efficient in terms of memory usage. 

More complicated data structures can take on many different forms. For example, a stack is a data structure that works like a drawer in a filing cabinet. To understand how a stack works, imagine that you are a small creature floating in space. If you want to get another creature to stack a book on top of an already stacked book, you would have to first move the books in the filing cabinet to get to where you need them. 

Similarly, in computer science, whenever we want to add an element to the end of a list, we have to waste time copying the entire list Sharon. To add an element to the end of a list in Python, we would use the Following code: 

list.append(item) 

Oftentimes, we want to remove an element from the end of a list, too. To remove an element from the end of a list in Python, we would use the Following code: 

list.remove(item) 

Stack data structures are extremely common in computer science because they are efficient in terms of memory usage. For example, if you are working with a list of 100 items, and you want to add an extra item to the end of the list, you would only have to copy the new item one time instead of 100 times. 

In addition to being efficient in terms of memory usage, stack data structures are also efficient in terms of processing. For example, if you are working with a list of 100 items One of the main purposes of data structures is to manage data. When you create a data structure, you are essentially giving the program a way to organize
