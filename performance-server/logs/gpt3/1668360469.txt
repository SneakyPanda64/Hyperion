Expand greatly upon the topic of "Algorithms in Scientific Computing: A Video Essay" in the context of computer science summarised for a 9th grader:

1. What is an algorithm?

An algorithm is a set of steps or instructions that are followed in order to solve a problem. Algorithms can be created to solve problems that are simple, like adding two numbers together, or they can be created to solve complex problems, like finding the shortest path between two points on a map.

2. What are some common algorithms used in scientific computing?
