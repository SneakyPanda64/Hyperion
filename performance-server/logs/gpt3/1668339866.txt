Extract tags that are directly related to "computer science" from the following passage of text in a comma seperated list format:

passage: Computer science is the study of how computers can be used to process and store data. Data Science Algorithms are the procedures used to analyze data and solve problems. They can be used to analyze large data sets, predict outcomes, and make decisions. There are many different types of Data Science Algorithms, including machine learning, regression, natural language processing, and data visualization. There are many benefits to using Data Science Algorithms. They can be used to analyze large data sets quickly and easily, predict outcomes, and make decisions. They can also be used to improve the accuracy and efficiency of many processes within a company. There are many different types of Data Science Algorithms. Some of the most common are machine learning, regression, natural language processing, and data visualization. Each of these types of algorithms can be used to solve different types of problems. Data Science Algorithms are commonly used in a number of different applications. They can be used to analyze large data sets, predict outcomes, and make decisions. They are also used to improve the accuracy and efficiency of many processes within a company. The future of Data Science Algorithms is very promising. They are continuing to improve and become more sophisticated, which means they are able to solve more complex problems. This is likely to continue as more and more businesses rely on data to make informed and efficient decisions.
