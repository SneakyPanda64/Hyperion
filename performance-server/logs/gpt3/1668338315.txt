Extract tags that are directly related to "computer science" from the following passage of text in a comma seperated list format:

passage: operations in order to search or sort the data. 

There are some algorithms that are specifically designed for large data sets. These algorithms are usually more complex and take longer to run. However, they are more efficient than algorithms designed for smaller data sets. 

Some examples of algorithms designed for large data sets include:  

MapReduce: This is a programming model that is designed for large data sets. It is used to process and generate large data sets.  

Hadoop: This is an open source software framework that is designed for large data sets. It supports the MapReduce programming model.  

Spark: This is a fast and general purpose cluster computing system. It is designed for large data sets. Streaming data is data that is generated continuously and in realtime. There are some algorithms that are specifically designed for streaming data. These algorithms are usually more complex and take longer to run. However, they are more efficient than algorithms designed for static data.

Some examples of algorithms designed for streaming data include:

Storm: This is a realtime processing system that is designed for streaming data.

Spark Streaming: This is an extension of the Spark platform that is designed for streaming data.

Flink: This is a framework for distributed stream and batch processing. There are some algorithms that are specifically designed for real time data. These algorithms are usually more complex and take longer to run. However, they are more efficient than algorithms designed for static data.
