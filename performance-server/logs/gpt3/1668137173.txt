Expand greatly upon the topic of "What is the difference between a heuristic and an algorithm?" in the context of computer science in british english:

1. What is the difference between a heuristic and an algorithm?

A heuristic is a rule of thumb that a computer scientist might use to get a rough approximation of the solution to a problem. An algorithm, on the other hand, is a specific, specific way of solving a problem.

2. How do heuristics and algorithms differ in terms of their application?

Heuristics are often used in situations where the specific algorithm is not necessary or the time required to execute the algorithm might be prohibitive. Algorithms, on the other hand, are often used in situations where the exact solution to a problem is necessary.

3. What are the benefits and drawbacks of using heuristics?

The benefits of using heuristics are that they can be timesaving and they may result in a close approximation of the solution to a problem. The drawback of using heuristics is that they may not always be the most accurate solution.

4. How can heuristics be used effectively in computer science?
