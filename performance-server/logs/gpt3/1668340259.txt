Extract tags that are directly related to "computer science" from the following passage of text in a comma seperated list format:

passage: An algorithm is a set of rules that tell a computer what to do. These rules can be inputted into a computer and will produce a specific result. Algorithms play an important role in security and cryptography because they help encrypt data and protect it from being read by unauthorized people. The key components of an algorithm are the instructions that tell the computer what to do. These instructions are written in a specific language, and they are used to make the algorithm work. The instructions can be complicated, but they all have one simple goal: to produce a particular result. When an algorithm is written down, it is often in a specific language. This language is called computer code. The code is written in a specific way so that a computer can understand it. Once the code is written, the algorithm can be translated into a set of instructions that a computer can actually carry out. One benefit of using algorithms is that they are easy to use. Once an algorithm has been created, it can be translated into computer code. This code can then be used to produce the desired result. This process is easy to understand and runs quickly, which makes it a desirable option for many applications. Algorithms are commonly used in a number of different applications. These applications include security and cryptography, data processing, and navigation. In security and cryptography, algorithms are used to encrypt data and protect it from being read by unauthorized people. In data processing, algorithms are used to process large amounts of data. This process can be done quickly and easily, which is beneficial in many cases. One of the key benefits of using algorithms is that they are easy to use. This is particularly true in the area of security and cryptography. Common security and cryptography algorithms include encrypting and decrypting data. These algorithms help protect data from being read by unauthorized people. Some common encryption algorithms are D.E.S.
and A.E.S.
In the area of cryptography, algorithms help protect data from being accessed by anyone other than the intended recipient. This is often done by using cryptography to secure data. Common cryptography algorithms include E.C.D.S.A.
and R.S.A. One way that algorithms can be used to improve security and cryptography is by using them to encrypt data. Encryption algorithms help protect data by transforming
