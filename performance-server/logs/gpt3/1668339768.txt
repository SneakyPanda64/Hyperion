Extract tags that are directly related to "computer science" from the following passage of text in a comma seperated list format:

passage: Algorithms are at the heart of everything that happens in artificial intelligence. They are the set of instructions that tell a computer what to do in order to solve a problem or complete a task. Some benefits of using algorithms in artificial intelligence include the ability to find new and more efficient ways to do things, the ability to automate repetitive tasks, and the ability to make better decisions by processing large amounts of data. There are many ways in which algorithms can be used to improve artificial intelligence. For example, algorithms can be used to design more efficient and effective search strategies, to develop new methods for pattern recognition, and to create better models of how the world works. Some challenges of using algorithms in artificial intelligence include the potential for bias and errors, the need for careful design and testing, and the expense of developing and maintaining complex algorithms. Algorithms are changing the field of artificial intelligence in many ways. They are making it possible to do things that were once thought to be impossible, such as understanding natural language and recognizing objects in images. They are also making artificial intelligence more accessible to people who are not computer scientists.
