Expand greatly upon the topic of "Algorithms for Sequence Processing: A Video Essay" in the context of computer science summarised for a 9th grader:

1. What is an algorithm?

An algorithm is a set of steps or instructions that is used to solve a problem. Algorithms can be written in a variety of different ways, but they all have in common the use of certain mathematical operations.

2. What are some common algorithms used for sequence processing?
