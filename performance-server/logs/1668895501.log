They can also be seen in some text editors and on some touch screens. In digital photography, each pixel represents one picture element.\\n\\n2. What is the difference between a raster and vector image?\\n\\nA raster image is one that is created by drawing pixels on a screen. A vector image is one that is created using mathematical formulas and is composed of lines, curves, and points.\\n\\n3.

JPEG is a file format that is used to save images that are scalable up to 8,000 by 600 pixels.\\n\\n4. How do pixels work?\\n\\nEach pixel on a computer screen has its own color, brightness, and position.
